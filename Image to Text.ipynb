      "\n",
      "**Q: What is JAVA?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** Java is a high-level, object-oriented, robust, secure, platform-independent, high-performance, and portable programming language. It was developed by James Gosling in 1991. It is also known as a platform as it provides its own JRE and API.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Features of JAVA?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** \n",
      "1. **Simple:** Java is easy to learn. The syntax is based on C++, making it easier to write programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Object-oriented:** Java follows an object-oriented paradigm, allowing code to be maintained as a combination of different types of objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Portable:** Java is \"write once, run anywhere.\"  Java programs are converted to bytecode (.class), which can run on any machine with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Platform-independent:** Java comes with its own platform (JVM) for code execution and does not depend on the operating system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Page 2**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A: (Continued Features of JAVA)**\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Secure:** Java is secure because it doesn't use explicit pointers.  It also provides the concept of bytecode and exception handling for increased security.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Robust:** Java is a strong programming language with strong memory management features like automatic garbage collection and exception handling.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Architecture Neutral:** Java is architecture-neutral and doesn't depend on a specific architecture.  Data type sizes may vary depending on whether it's a 32-bit or 64-bit architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Interpreted:** Java uses a JIT (Just-In-Time) interpreter along with the compiler for program execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **High Performance:** Java is faster than other traditional languages because Java bytecode is \"close\" to native code.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Multi-threaded:**  Multi-threading allows multiple parts of a program to run concurrently, sharing common memory, which is more efficient than creating separate memory for each thread.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Distributed:** RMI (Remote Method Invocation) and EJB (Enterprise Java Beans) are used for creating distributed applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Dynamic:** Java is a dynamic language. It supports dynamic loading of classes, meaning classes are loaded on demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Page 3**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: What do you understand by JVM?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a virtual machine that allows computers to run Java programs. It acts like a runtime engine, calling the main method in the Java code. The Java code is compiled by the JVM into bytecode, which is close to native code.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: How many types of memory are allocated by JVM?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:**\n",
      "1. Heap (for objects)\n",
      "2. Class Area\n",
      "3. Static\n",
      "4. Native Method Stack\n",
      "5. Program Counter Register\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: What is a platform?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**A:** A platform is a set of hardware and software environments in which a piece of software is executed. Java is a software-based platform.\n",
